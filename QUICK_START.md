5. Your site will be live at: yourname.github.io/yourname-glp1-site

**Netlify (Also Free & Easy)**
1. Go to https://www.netlify.com
2. Sign up for free account

**What to do:**
1. Sign up and buy hosting plan
2. Get a domain name (yoursite.com) - usually included first year
3. Use their "File Manager" or FTP to upload your files
4. Put files in "public_html" folder

## Step 2: Replace Affiliate Links

1. Open `index.html` in a text editor (Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac)
2. Press Ctrl+F (Cmd+F on Mac) to open Find
3. Search for: `YOUR_AFFILIATE_LINK_1`
4. Replace with your actual affiliate link
5. Repeat for `YOUR_AFFILIATE_LINK_2` and `YOUR_AFFILIATE_LINK_3`
6. Save the file

**Don't have affiliate links yet?** 
- Keep the placeholder links for now
- Apply to programs (see Step 4)
- Update links once approved (takes 1-7 days)

## Step 3: Customize Your Site

### Change Site Name:
Find this line in `index.html`:
```html
<div class="logo">GLP-1 Compare</div>
```
Change to your site name:
```html
<div class="logo">Your Site Name</div>
```

### Update Provider Names:
Search for "Provider 1" and replace with actual company name (like "Hims")
Do the same for Provider 2 and Provider 3

### Update Prices:
Find `$297/month` and change to real prices from the actual programs

## Step 4: Apply to Affiliate Programs

### If Rejected:
Don't worry! Common reasons:
- Site too new (wait 2-4 weeks, add more content)

- Apply to different program

## Step 5: Get Traffic (Start Making Money)

### Week 1: Setup Social Media
Create accounts on:
- Pinterest (best for health content!)
- Instagram
- TikTok
- Twitter/X

Post your comparison chart as an image with link to site

### Week 2-4: Write Blog Posts
Add 3-5 articles to your site:
- "How GLP-1 Medications Work"
- "Semaglutide vs Tirzepatide: What's the Difference?"
- "How Much Does Online Weight Loss Treatment Cost?"
- "Is Compounded Semaglutide Safe?"
- "Wegovy Alternatives: Best Online Options"

**Can't write?** 
- Use ChatGPT to help (feed it research, ask it to write)
- Hire writer on Fiverr ($30-50 per article)
- Use AI writing tools (Jasper, Copy.ai)

### Month 2: Paid Ads (Optional)
Start small:
- Google Ads: $10/day budget
- Target: "online weight loss program", "buy semaglutide online"
- Track what works, stop what doesn't

OR

- Facebook Ads: $10/day
- Target: Women 35-55, interested in weight loss
- Use educational content, not sales-y

### Month 3+: SEO
- Submit site to Google Search Console
- Get listed in health directories
- Guest post on other health blogs
- Build backlinks gradually

## Step 6: Track Your Success

### Install Google Analytics
1. Go to https://analytics.google.com
2. Create free account
3. Get tracking code
4. Add to `index.html` before `</head>` tag:

```html
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=YOUR-ID"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'YOUR-ID');
</script>
```

Replace `YOUR-ID` with your actual tracking ID

### What to Track:
- Daily visitors
- Which pages get most traffic
- Where visitors come from
- How many click your affiliate links

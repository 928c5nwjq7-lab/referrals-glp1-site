                <h1>Affiliate Disclosure & Disclaimer</h1>
                <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 18, 2024</p>

                <h2>Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
                <p>At WellGuide Health, our mission is to share trustworthy, evidence-based health information you can rely on. To help keep our content free for readers, some of the links on WellGuideHealth.com are affiliate links. This means that if you click on a link and make a purchase from one of our partners, we may earn a small commission—at no extra cost to you.</p>

                <p><strong>We only feature products and services that we would confidently use ourselves and believe could genuinely benefit our readers.</strong> Our recommendations are based on research, user reviews, safety standards, and the goal of supporting your wellness journey—never on commission rates.</p>

                <p>No matter the relationship, every recommendation is evaluated using our comprehensive review process to ensure the provider meets our strict standards for affordability, safety, medical legitimacy, and long-term success.</p>

                <h3>Our Current Partners Include:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shed</li>
                    <li>Hims</li>
                    <li>Ro</li>
                    <li>Calibrate</li>
                    <li>Found</li>
                </ul>

                <p><em>This list may be updated as we review new providers and partnerships change.</em></p>

                <h2>How We Maintain Independence</h2>
                <p>We want to be crystal clear about how we handle affiliate relationships:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Commission Rates Don't Affect Rankings:</strong> Some providers pay higher commissions than others, but this never influences our rankings or recommendations. We rank providers based solely on their quality, safety, pricing, and user experience.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>We Don't Hide Negative Information:</strong> If a provider has issues—high prices, poor customer service, safety concerns—we'll tell you about them, even if we have an affiliate relationship with that provider.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>We Won't Recommend Bad Providers:</strong> No amount of money will make us recommend a provider that doesn't meet our standards. If a provider is unsafe, deceptive, or offers poor value, we won't feature them.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>We Update Reviews Regularly:</strong> Provider quality can change over time. We regularly update our reviews based on new information, user feedback, and changes to pricing or services.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Important Health Disclaimer</h2>
                <p><strong>WellGuide Health is for informational purposes only. We do not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</strong></p>

                <h1>About WellGuide Health</h1>
                <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 18, 2024</p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>At WellGuide Health, we believe everyone deserves access to clear, honest information about online GLP-1 weight loss programs. Our mission is to cut through the marketing noise and help you find safe, affordable, and effective options that actually work.</p>

                <h2>Why We Started WellGuide Health</h2>
                <p>The online weight loss industry is overwhelming. Some providers charge thousands of dollars per month while others cut corners on safety. Hidden fees are everywhere, and it's nearly impossible to know who to trust.</p>
                
                <p>We created WellGuide Health to solve this problem. Our team researches, tests, and reviews online GLP-1 programs so you don't have to spend hours comparing providers yourself.</p>

                <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
                <p><strong>We're Independent:</strong> We're not owned by any weight loss company or pharmacy. Our reviews are based solely on our research and real user experiences.</p>
                
                <p><strong>We're Transparent:</strong> We clearly disclose when we earn affiliate commissions and never let that influence our honest reviews. If a provider has issues, we'll tell you about them.</p>
                
                <p><strong>We Do the Research:</strong> Our team spends dozens of hours researching each provider—reading user reviews, analyzing pricing structures, verifying medical credentials, and testing customer service.</p>
                
                <p><strong>We Focus on What Matters:</strong> Price, safety, support, and results. We cut through marketing claims to tell you what actually matters when choosing a GLP-1 program.</p>

                <h2>Our Review Process</h2>
                <p>Every provider we review goes through our comprehensive evaluation process:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Medical Safety:</strong> We verify that providers use licensed physicians, require health screenings, and follow proper medical protocols</li>
                    <li><strong>Pricing Transparency:</strong> We dig into the actual costs including hidden fees, shipping charges, and consultation costs</li>
                    <li><strong>Medication Quality:</strong> We confirm whether providers use FDA-approved medications or compounded alternatives from reputable pharmacies</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer Support:</strong> We evaluate response times, support availability, and how providers handle problems</li>
                    <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> We analyze hundreds of real customer reviews to understand the actual patient experience</li>
                    <li><strong>Long-term Success:</strong> We look at whether providers offer coaching, lifestyle support, and tools for maintaining weight loss</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Our Standards</h2>
                <p>We only recommend providers that meet our strict criteria:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>✓ Licensed medical professionals who prescribe medication</li>
                    <li>✓ Transparent pricing with no hidden fees</li>
                    <li>✓ Safe medications from legitimate sources</li>
                    <li>✓ Responsive customer support</li>
                    <li>✓ Clear cancellation policies</li>
                    <li>✓ Positive track record with real users</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How We Make Money</h2>
                <p>WellGuide Health is supported through affiliate partnerships. When you click a link to a provider on our site and sign up for their service, we may earn a commission at no extra cost to you.</p>
                
                <p>This is how we keep our content free while investing time in thorough research and reviews. However, we never let affiliate relationships influence our honest opinions. We feature providers based solely on their merit, not on commission rates.</p>
                
                <p>If a provider doesn't meet our standards, we won't recommend them—regardless of how much they pay in commissions.</p>

                <h2>Our Commitment to You</h2>
                <p>We're committed to:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Providing accurate, up-to-date information</li>
                    <li>Being transparent about our affiliate relationships</li>
                    <li>Updating our reviews when providers change their policies or pricing</li>
                    <li>Listening to your feedback and improving our content</li>
                    <li>Never recommending unsafe or predatory providers</li>
                </ul>
